                    The Crusades were a series of religious wars initiated, supported, and sometimes directed by the
                    Latin Church in the medieval period. The best known of these Crusades are those to the Holy Land
                    in
                    the period between 1095 and 1291 that were intended to recover Jerusalem and its surrounding
                    area
                    from Islamic rule. Concurrent military activities in the Iberian Peninsula against the Moors
                    (the
                    Reconquista) and in northern Europe against pagan West Slavic, Baltic and Finnic peoples (the
                    Northern Crusades) also became known as crusades. Through the 15th century, other
                    church-sanctioned
                    crusades were fought against heretical Christian sects, against the Byzantine and Ottoman
                    empires,
                    to combat paganism and heresy, and for political reasons. Unsanctioned by the church, Popular
                    Crusades of ordinary citizens were also frequent. Beginning with the First Crusade which
                    resulted in
                    the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, dozens of Crusades were fought, providing a focal point of
                    European history for centuries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1095, Pope Urban II proclaimed the First Crusade at the Council of Clermont. He encouraged
                    military support for Byzantine emperor Alexios I against the Seljuk Turks and called for an
                    armed
                    pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Across all social strata in western Europe, there was an enthusiastic
                    popular response. The first Crusaders had a variety of motivations, including religious
                    salvation,
                    satisfying feudal obligations, opportunities for renown, and economic or political advantage.
                    Later
                    crusades were generally conducted by more organized armies, sometimes led by a king. All were
                    granted papal indulgences. Initial successes established four Crusader states: the County of
                    Edessa;
                    the Principality of Antioch; the Kingdom of Jerusalem; and the County of Tripoli. The Crusader
                    presence remained in the region in some form until the fall of Acre in 1291. After this, there
                    were
                    no further crusades to recover the Holy Land.

                    Proclaimed a crusade in 1123, the struggle between the Christians and Muslims in the Iberian
                    Peninsula was called the Reconquista by Christians, and only ended in 1492 with the fall of the
                    Muslim Emirate of Granada. From 1147, campaigns in Northern Europe against pagan tribes were
                    considered crusades. In 1199, Pope Innocent III began the practice of proclaiming political
                    crusades
                    against Christian heretics. In the 13th century, crusading was used against the Cathars in
                    Languedoc
                    and against Bosnia; this practice continued against the Waldensians in Savoy and the Hussites in
                    Bohemia in the 15th century and against Protestants in the 16th. From the mid-14th century,
                    crusading rhetoric was used in response to the rise of the Ottoman Empire, and ended around 1699
                    with the War of the Holy League.

                <h1 id="2">The Different Periods of Crusades</h1>
                <hr>
                <h2 id="3">First Crusade (1096-99)</h2>
                <p>
                    Four armies of Crusaders were formed from troops of different Western European regions, led by
                    Raymond of Saint-Gilles, Godfrey of Bouillon, Hugh of Vermandois and Bohemond of Taranto (with his
                    nephew Tancred). These groups departed for Byzantium in August 1096.A less organized band of knights
                    and commoners known as the “People’s Crusade” set off before the others under the command of a
                    popular preacher known as Peter the Hermit.

                    Ignoring Alexius’ advice to wait for the rest of the Crusaders, Peter’s army crossed the Bosporus in
                    early August. In the first major clash between the Crusaders and Muslims, Turkish forces crushed the
                    invading Europeans at Cibotus.

                    Another group of Crusaders, led by the notorious Count Emicho, carried out a series of massacres of
                    Jews in various towns in the Rhineland in 1096, drawing widespread outrage and causing a major
                    crisis in Jewish-Christian relations.

                    When the four main armies of Crusaders arrived in Constantinople, Alexius insisted that their
                    leaders swear an oath of loyalty to him and recognize his authority over any land regained from the
                    Turks, as well as any other territory they might conquer. All but Bohemond resisted taking the oath.

                    In May 1097, the Crusaders and their Byzantine allies attacked Nicea (now Iznik, Turkey), the Seljuk
                    capital in Anatolia. The city surrendered in late June.
                </p>
                <h2 id="4">Second Crusade (1147-49)</h2>
                <p>
                    Having achieved their goal in an unexpectedly short period of time after the First Crusade, many of
                    the Crusaders departed for home. To govern the conquered territory, those who remained established
                    four large western settlements, or Crusader states, in Jerusalem, Edessa, Antioch and Tripoli.

                    Guarded by formidable castles, the Crusader states retained the upper hand in the region until
                    around 1130, when Muslim forces began gaining ground in their own holy war (or jihad) against the
                    Christians, whom they called “Franks.”

                    In 1144, the Seljuk general Zangi, governor of Mosul, captured Edessa, leading to the loss of the
                    northernmost Crusader state.


                    News of Edessa’s fall stunned Europe and caused Christian authorities in the West to call for
                    another Crusade. Led by two great rulers, King Louis VII of France and King Conrad III of Germany,
                    the Second Crusade began in 1147.

                    That October, the Turks annihilated Conrad’s forces at Dorylaeum, the site of a great Christian
                    victory during the First Crusade.

                    After Louis and Conrad managed to assemble their armies at Jerusalem, they decided to attack the
                    Syrian stronghold of Damascus with an army of some 50,000 (the largest Crusader force yet).

                    Damascus’ ruler was forced to call on Nur al-Din, Zangi’s successor in Mosul, for aid. The combined
                    Muslim forces dealt a humiliating defeat to the Crusaders, decisively ending the Second Crusade.

                    Nur al-Din added Damascus to his expanding empire in 1154.

                <h2 id="5">Third Crusade (1187-92)</h2>
                <p>
                    After numerous attempts by the Crusaders of Jerusalem to capture Egypt, Nur al-Din’s forces (led by
                    the general Shirkuh and his nephew, Saladin) seized Cairo in 1169 and forced the Crusader army to
                    evacuate.

                    Upon Shirkuh’s subsequent death, Saladin assumed control and began a campaign of conquests that
                    accelerated after Nur al-Din’s death in 1174.

                    In 1187, Saladin began a major campaign against the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. His troops
                    virtually destroyed the Christian army at the battle of Hattin, taking back the important city along
                    with a large amount of territory.

                    Outrage over these defeats inspired the Third Crusade, led by rulers such as the aging Emperor
                    Frederick Barbarossa (who was drowned at Anatolia before his entire army reached Syria), King Philip
                    II of France, and King Richard I of England (known as Richard the Lionheart).

                    In September 1191, Richard’s forces defeated those of Saladin in the battle of Arsuf, which would be
                    the only true battle of the Third Crusade.

                    From the recaptured city of Jaffa, Richard reestablished Christian control over some of the region
                    and approached Jerusalem, though he refused to lay siege to the city.

                    In September 1192, Richard and Saladin signed a peace treaty that reestablished the Kingdom of
                    Jerusalem (though without the city of Jerusalem) and ended the Third Crusade.
                </p>

                <h2 id="6">Final Crusades (1208-1271)</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the remainder of the 13th century, a variety of Crusades aimed not so much to topple
                    Muslim forces in the Holy Land but to combat any and all of those seen as enemies of the Christian
                    faith.

                    The Albigensian Crusade (1208-29) aimed to root out the heretical Cathari or Albigensian sect of
                    Christianity in France, while the Baltic Crusades (1211-25) sought to subdue pagans in Transylvania.

                    A so-called Children’s Crusade took place in 1212 when thousands of young children vowed to march to
                    Jerusalem. Although it was called the Children’s Crusade, most historians don’t regard it as an
                    actual crusade, and many experts question whether the group was really comprised of children. The
                    movement never reached the Holy Land.

                    In the Fifth Crusade, put in motion by Pope Innocent III before his death in 1216, the Crusaders
                    attacked Egypt from both land and sea but were forced to surrender to Muslim defenders led by
                    Saladin’s nephew, Al-Malik al-Kamil, in 1221.

                    In 1229, in what became known as the Sixth Crusade, Emperor Frederick II achieved the peaceful
                    transfer of Jerusalem to Crusader control through negotiation with al-Kamil. The peace treaty
                    expired a decade later, and Muslims easily regained control of Jerusalem.

                    From 1248 to 1254, Louis IX of France organized a crusade against Egypt. This battle, known as the
                    Seventh Crusade, was a failure for Louis.

                <h2 id="8">The Mamluks</h2>
                <p>
                    As the Crusaders struggled, a new dynasty, known as the Mamluks, descended from former slaves of the
                    Islamic Empire, took power in Egypt. In 1260, Mamluk forces in Palestine managed to halt the advance
                    of the Mongols, an invading force led by Genghis Khan and his descendants, which had emerged as a
                    potential ally for the Christians in the region.

                    Under the ruthless Sultan Baybars, the Mamluks demolished Antioch in 1268. In response, Louis
                    organized the Eighth Crusade in 1270. The initial goal was to aid the remaining Crusader states in
                    Syria, but the mission was redirected to Tunis, where Louis died.


                    Edward I of England took on another expedition in 1271. This battle, which is often grouped with the
                    Eighth Crusade but is sometimes referred to as the Ninth Crusade, accomplished very little and was
                    considered the last significant crusade to the Holy Land.
                </p>
                <h2 id="9">The Crusades End</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1291, one of the only remaining Crusader cities, Acre, fell to the Muslim Mamluks. Many
                    historians believe this defeat marked the end of the Crusader States and the Crusades themselves.

                    Though the Church organized minor Crusades with limited goals after 1291—mainly military campaigns
                    aimed at pushing Muslims from conquered territory, or conquering pagan regions—support for such
                    efforts diminished in the 16th century, with the rise of the Reformation and the corresponding
                    decline of papal authority.

                <p>
                    While the Crusades ultimately resulted in defeat for Europeans and a Muslim victory, many argue that
                    they successfully extended the reach of Christianity and Western civilization. The Roman Catholic
                    Church experienced an increase in wealth, and the power of the Pope was elevated after the Crusades
                    ended.

                    Trade and transportation also improved throughout Europe as a result of the Crusades. The wars
                    created a constant demand for supplies and transportation, which resulted in ship-building and the
                    manufacturing of various supplies.

                    After the Crusades, there was a heightened interest in travel and learning throughout Europe, which
                    some historians believe may have paved the way for the Renaissance.

                    Among followers of Islam, however, the Crusaders were regarded as immoral, bloody and savage. The
                    ruthless and widespread massacre of Muslims, Jews and other non-Christians resulted in bitter
                    resentment that persisted for many years. Even today, some Muslims derisively refer to the West’s
                    involvement in the Middle East as a “crusade.”

                    There’s no question that the years of bloody conflict brought by the Crusades had an impact on
                    Middle East and Western European nations for many years, and still influence political and cultural
                    views and opinions held today.
