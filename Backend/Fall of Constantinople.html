                <hr>
                <h5><b>by Vino Endang Ramadhan</b>, July 4, 2022</h5>
                <p>The fall of Constantinople was an event of a raid on the capital of the Byzantine Empire by the Ottoman army on May 29, 1453. The attackers, led by 21-year-old Sultan Mehmed II, defeated an army commanded by Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos and took control of the royal capital, ending the siege that began on April 6, 1453. After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmed converted the Ottoman capital from Edirne to Constantinople and established his rule there. Our conquest and the two byzantine splinter territories soon after marked the end of the Roman Empire that had stood for 1500 years.</p>
                <p>The conquest of Constantinople also exerted a great influence on the defense of mainland Europe, as the Ottoman Muslim army expanded its conquest. The event of the fall of Constantinople is also a new history in the history of the military. Since ancient times, cities have used fortifications and city walls to protect themselves from invaders and the defense of Constantinople has been a model followed by cities in the Mediterranean and Europe. The Ottomans ultimately won thanks to the use of gunpowder that strengthened the cannons – great cannons. The conquest of the city of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire were key events in the late middle ages that also marked the end of the Medieval period for some historians.</p>

                <hr>
                    <p>Constantinople has been the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantine Empire since 330/324 by the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (Constantine I). In the eleven centuries that followed in the history of Constantinople, the city has been besieged many times but has only ever been penetrated once, namely during the events of The Fourth Crusade in 1204. The crusaders established Latin states in and around Constantinople while the rest of the empire split into several Byzantine successor states such as Nicaea, Epirus and Trebizond. They fought as allies against the Latin occupation but also fought against each other for the Byzantine throne.</p>

                    </div>    
                    <p>The Nicaeans then succeeded in recapturing Constantinople from the Latin army in 1261, reestablishing the Byzantine Empire under the leadership of the Palaiogolos dynasty. After that the empire was still under attack from the Latin, Serbian, Bulgarian and finally Ottoman armies. The black plague or Black Plague that struck between 1346 – 1349 killed almost half of the inhabitants of Constantinople. The town was later also reduced in population due to economic conditions and territorial problems, and in 1453 included a number of fortified villages separated by fields – fields surrounded by Theodosian Walls founded in the fifth century. In 1450 the empire began to degenerate and shrink to an area of several square kilometers outside the city of Constantinople, Prince's Island in the Sea of Marmara, as well as the Peloponnese with a cultural center in Mystras. The Trebizond Empire formed after the Fourth Crusade also survived on the black sea coast.

                <h1 id="3">Preparations for the Ottoman Invasion</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>When Sultan Mehmed II continued his father's leadership in 1451 he was only 19 years old. Many European rulers considered that the young king would not seriously oppose Christian hegemony in the Balkans and Aegeans. This calculation was reinforced by Mehmed's friendly attitude to the European envoys to his new government. But Mehmed's sweet words are not the same as his actions. In early 1452 began construction work on a second fortress called Rumeli Hisari in the Bosphorus Strait, on the territory of Europe a few miles north of Constantinople./p>
                <p>It is located right opposite the Asian side of the Anadolu Hisari fortress built by his great-grandfather Bayezid I. This pair of fortifications will ensure full control of sea traffic in the Bosphorus Strait and will be a defense against the attacks of the Genoese colonies on the Black Sea coast to the north. In October 1452 before the fall of Constantinople, Mehmed ordered turakhan Beg to station a large garrison in the Peloponnese to block Thomas and Demetrios of Greece to provide assistance to his brother Constantine X Palaiologos during the siege in the event of the fall of Constantinople.</p>                    
                <div class="responsive"><img src="Images/Battle_of_Varna_1444.PNG" alt="" width="550" height="350"><p>the Battle of Varna in 1444.</p></div>
                <p>The Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI soon understood Mehmed's original intentions and asked for help to Western Europe, yet centuries – centuries of war and enmity between the eastern and western churches ultimately showed its influence. In the summer of 1452 when Rumeli Hisari was completed and the threat had become apparent, Constantine wrote a letter to the Pope and promised to renew the communion of the church that had been declared valid by the imperial council on December 12, 1452. Nevertheless, Pope Nicholas V apparently had no influence on the kings and princes of the West especially after France and England were weakening after the Hundred Years' War, Spain with the War against the Holy Roman Empire, and the defeat of Hungary and Poland at the Battle of Varna in 1444.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, there were still some troops coming from various regions to help prevent the fall of Constantinople. Mehmed II had one thing that the previous attackers did not namely the cannon – the large cannon. This cannon was originally offered to Emperor Constantine by its inventor a Hungarian named Urban, but did not reach a price agreement. The cannon later became Mehmed's. The largest cannon measures 9 meters long with a mouth as big as one meter that can fire a 500-kilogram ball for 1.5 kilometers. Because of its size, this cannon takes a long time to replenish so that it can only be fired seven times per day. But the Ottomans still had many smaller cannons and were able to fire more than 100 times per day.</p>
                <p>On April 5 Mehmed sent demands for immediate surrender but received no response. The attack began on April 6 and crushed the Theodosian Walls to the ground. The attack lasted for six weeks later but with persistent resistance. On April 20 there were three Genoese ships sent by the Pope and a ship from Alphonso of Aragon were able to break through the Ottoman naval blockade and reach the defending soldiers. Mehmed who faced several rebellions offered Constantine a deal to pay tribute and he would step down.

                <hr>
                <p>When it was repulsed, the attacks were launched more vigorously on May 29 in the early hours of the morning. The first attack after the cannon was deployed by the second-tier troops, followed by a second attack with troops of the same level above it, and finally closed with an attack by an elite Mehmed army called the Janissaries. The Byzantines were eventually forced to mobilize women and children to prevent the fall of Constantinople, but some people who were caught off guard left the gates of Kerkoporta open and the soldiers of the Janissaries did not hesitate to take advantage of it. They climbed all the way up to the top of the wall and waved the Ottoman flag, then detoured to the main gate and let their leader enter the city.</p>
                <p>Emperor Constantine was killed at this time probably near St. Romano's Gate despite having abandoned his various imperial attributes to avoid his body being used as a victory trophy. It is said that about 4000 inhabitants at the fall of Constantinople were killed and 50 thousand were made slaves. In the afternoon Mehmed entered the city and declared that the Hagia Sophia church would be used as a mosque, ending the city's 12 centuries of role as a Christian fortress. Constantinople was made the new Ottoman capital, the Christian community was liberated under the leadership of Bishop Gennadeios II. What remained of the Byzantine Empire was incorporated into Ottoman territory, following the conquests of Mistra in 1460 and Trebizond in 1461. Mehmed ruled for a long time for 28 years as Sultan.</p>

                <h1 id="5">Causes of the Byzantine defeat</h1>
                <hr>
                <h2 id="6">Latin Intervention</h2>
                <p>The Latin presence in the Balkans seriously undermined the Byzantines' ability to coordinate their efforts against the Ottoman Turks. This is exemplified by Michael VIII Palaeologus, whose attempts to drive the Latins out of Greece led to the abandonment of the Anatolian borders which allowed several beyliks, as well as the Turks of Osman I to raid and settle former Byzantine lands. Andronicus II's campaigns in Anatolia, though it obtained some military success, was constantly thwarted by events in the west of the Empire.[35] In any event, the Byzantines were forced to choose between Papal and Latin threat of attack or an unpopular union, which was exploited by numerous rival claimants as cause for a coup against the Byzantine Emperor.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, towards the mid and late 14th century, the Byzantines began to receive nominal aid from the West. This was little more than sympathy toward a fellow Christian power fighting a Muslim power and despite two Crusades, the Byzantines "received as much help from Rome as we did from the [Mamluk] sultan [of Egypt]".[40] The Mamluk Sultanate in the 13th century had been one of the most determined powers to remove Christian influence in the Middle East and raiding by Cyprus did not change this in the 14th and 15th centuries</p>

                <h2 id="7">Ottoman Strengths</h2>
                <p>The Ottomans had great diplomatic skill and ability to raise vast numbers of troops. Initially, their raiding gave them great support from other Turks near Osman's small domain. In time however, as the Turks began to settle in land poorly defended by the Byzantines,[41] they were able to exploit the hardships of the peasant classes by recruiting their aid. Those that did not assist the Ottomans were raided themselves. Eventually, the cities in Asia Minor, cut off from the outside surrendered and the Ottomans soon mastered the art of siege warfare.</p>
                <p>It was the Ottomans' skill with dealing with their opponents that made them very powerful very quickly. They would subjugate their opponents as vassals rather than destroy them,[23] otherwise they would have exhausted themselves in the process. The exacting of tribute from conquered states in the form of children and money was effective in forcing subjugation over conquest. Coupled with this, the entire region was composed of many states (Bulgaria, Serbia, Latin states) who would just as soon fight each other as the Ottomans and realized too late that the Ottoman forces defeated them by integrating them in a network of subordinate states.[citation needed]
