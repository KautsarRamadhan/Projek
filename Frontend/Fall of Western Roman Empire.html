                <h2 id="2">Location and When Western Roman Empire Stands</h2>
                <p>Roman emperors reigned in the period between 27BC, officially, and AD 395. At this point, the Empire was divided into two distinct parts – the Eastern Roman Empire and the Western Roman Empire. After a century, in 476, the western emperor was overthrown, and the Eastern Empire continued under a different name – Byzantium.</p>
                <p>As was the case with all empires, the borders of the Roman Empire fluctuated and changed as successive rulers lost and gained territory in battle. But the Empire’s borders spread to what is now Iran and the Persian Gulf in the east, through Asia Minor, Europe south of the Danube, to France, Spain, and what is now England. The Roman Empire also ruled territory on the northern coast of Africa – in modern-day Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, and Libya. This empire was centered around the Mediterranean.</p>

                <h2 class="3">Origins of the Roman Empire</h2>
                <p>Rome was founded in 753 BC, supposedly by the brothers Romulus and Remus, and became a republic in 509 BC with the creation of the Roman Senate. This resulted in a leadership of judges, who collectively debated and made decisions about the government of Roman society. Rome continued to expand its borders, but did not extend beyond what is now Italy until 300 BC – and, while it was not yet officially an empire, this behavior was already vaguely imperial.</p>
                <p>In 45 BC, after successful wars, a certain Julius Caesar was given the title ‘dictator’ of Rome. However, just a year later, he was assassinated and, given his popularity among the Roman underclass, there was a revolt and, eventually, civil war.</p>
                <p>While this was continued by Marc Anthony and Octavian – Caesar’s adopted son – against Caesar’s assassins, the two eventually turned against each other, and the war ended in the defeat of Marc Antony in 31 BC. Octavian was consequently given the title by the senate ‘first citizen’ – and this is considered the first moment in Rome that made it truly imperial.</p>
                <p>Octavian was known as Augustus, and he dominated the senate which, at least in name, was still the highest authority in Rome. The Augustus dynasty led Rome through a period of unprecedented peace and prosperity.</p>

                <h2 id="5">Julio-Claudian dynasty</h2>
                <p>Octavian, or Augustus, was the first emperor of what came to be known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty. His reign was very successful in expanding the territory over which the Empire ruled: he conquered parts of Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, and Algeria, as well as much of the northern Mediterranean. He also brought Roman control of the Iberian Peninsula, now modern Spain and Portugal, and made peace with the Parthian Empire in Iran to ensure a stable border on the eastern frontier.</p>
                <p>The Julio-Claudian dynasty consisted of Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Emperor Nero. Claudius began the conquest of Britannia, which continued through massive expansion under Vespasian and with the famous wall across the Scottish borders conquered by Hadrian.</p>
                <p>Nero’s notorious fickle personality ruled unhappily during the year of the Great Fire of Rome in 64AD, and his suicide led to a civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors, 69AD. This ended the Julio-Claudian dynasty.</p>

                <h2 id="6">Flavian dynasty</h2>
                <p>The Flavian dynasty began in 69 with Emperor Vespasian, which was the last of the Years of the Four Emperors. He was the Emperor who built Rome’s famous Colosseum, which was completed and refurbished by his heirs Titus and Domitian (this is why it is also known as the Flavian Amphitheater).</p>
                <p>When hit by a number of great problems – the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 which destroyed Pompeii and Herculaneum, and the fires and plagues of Rome in 80 – Titus was considered a very capable ruler. However, he died young, and his younger brother, Domitian, succeeded him in 81.</p>
                <p>Domitian was assassinated in 96, because he was known as an autocratic and cruel emperor. He was replaced by an advisor, Nerva.</p>

                <h2 id="7">The Nerva-Antonine Dynasty, or the Five Good Emperors</h2>
                <p>The dynasty that Nerva founded was known as the Nerva-Antonine Dynasty, and the five emperors including – Nerva himself, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus, and Marcus Aurelius – were known as the Five Good Emperors.</p>
                <p>Trajan, the only Roman emperor who was not born on the Italian peninsula, built the Empire into its most extensive form. He conquered Dacia – now Romania, Moldova, parts of Bulgaria, Hungary, Ukraine, Slovakia, Serbia, and Poland – as well as Syria.</p>
                <p>The Nerva-Antonine dynasty ruled between 96 and 192, and the reign of Commodus, the last in the dynasty, is believed to signal the decline of the Roman Empire.</p>

                <h2 id="9">Achievements of the Roman Empire</h2>
                <p>Like the Mongolian and British Empires, the Roman Empire led a long period of peace – at least within the limits of its power. This is known as Pax Romana, which allows for a flourishing trade that has never been seen before.</p>
                <p>In very practical terms, the main legacy of the Roman Empire was in engineering – in the construction of roads (famous for being very straight) and waterways. Aqueducts were used to move water and the Romans built and used them to carry water to cities, markets, and farms. The Segovia aqueduct, built during the reigns of Domitian, Nerva, and Trajan, is a famous example.</p>
                <p>In art, Roman culture excelled in poetry, drama, and sculpture – and anyone who has studied Latin in school will know that we are still learning about this achievement today, for it shaped the way we write, read and be entertained, even until today. Latin itself was, in effect, the language of politics throughout Europe for the next nearly thousand years.</p>
                <p>The Roman Empire then – after its disintegration – made Christianity the official religion, beginning with the conversion of Constantine the Great. This led to the spread of religion, and Judeo-Christian culture in general, from east to west across the empire.</p>

                <h2 id="10">The Division of the Roman Empire: East and West</h2>
                <p>After the last of the Five Good Emperors, Marcus Aurelius, Commodus’ reign began the decline of the empire. In 192 he was assassinated, beginning the Year of the Five Emperors. This initiated massive political instability into the empire, culminating in the Crisis of the Third Century, beginning with Septimius Severus’ seizure of power in 193 that set a precedent for the rest of the century.</p>
                <p>After a number of barbarian invasions throughout the centuries, and with plagues and natural disasters excite the empire from within, Diocletian took control of the empire in 284 and ended the crisis. His response was to divide the great empire in two.</p>
                <p>The East would be ruled by Diocletian in Constantinople, or Istanbul, and would be known as the Byzantine Empire, along with the West, which moved from Rome to Milan.</p>

                <h2 id="12">The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</h2>
                <p>In the end, the two then independent empires fell apart, although the Eastern Empire lasted longer under the guise of the Byzantine Empire.</p>
                <p>Odoacer, the savage King of Italy, who ultimately led to the collapse of the very weak Western Empire by incompetent leaders and through invasions by Vandals, Ostrogoths, and Visigoths. Odoacer, a Goth based in northern Italy, overthrew the last Western Emperor, Romulus Augustulus in 476.</p>
                <p>The Byzantine Empire, better known as the Byzantine Empire, lasted until its fall to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, reclaimed lands lost during the Crisis of the Third Century, while Justinian (527-565). Trying to reclaim the lands of the Western Empire.</p>
                <div class="responsive"><img src="Images/Formne.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"><p>Fall of Roman Empire</p></div>
                <p>Justinian’s contributions to law, his large types of building projects, and his leadership during times of greater prosperity have made him known in history as Justinian the Great – and even as the last Roman Emperor.</p>
                <p>After this, Byzantium slowly declined, and Constantinople was finally conquered by Mehmed the Conqueror in 1453, the Ottoman Emperor.</p>
                <p>Although many historians consider the Roman Empire  to be divided into two parts between the west and the east, it seems that the view was not the same as that of the Roman society of its time. The two, in fact, supported each other’s Romans whose power was so vast.</p>
                <p>However, look at it in the fifth century AD. It is said that this period was the end of the Romans in the west which was the city of Rome. His story is mentioned as the fall of the Romans before control of his sole power remained in Constantinople.</p>
                <p>The story of the fall of the Roman Empire in the West begins with the death of the emperor Anthemius in 472 AD. In the now divided Roman system of government in two parts, the appointment of the emperor was made by appointment of the eastern emperor. Previously, Anthemius was appointed in 467 AD by the eastern emperor Leo I.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, a great general in Dalmatia (present-day Albania, Croatia, Bosnia, and Herzegovina), Marcellinus died and was succeeded by his nephew Julius Nepos in 468 AD. Nepos had a kinship with Leo I by marrying his niece.</p>
                <p>To fill the vacant post of emperor, Olybrius the real ruler was supported by the Roman general of Germanic descent Flavius Ricimer, but his power was only four months in 472 AD due to his death.</p>
                <p>Then Olybrius was replaced by Glycerius. Both are not recognized by Leo as emperors in the west. Leo instead chose Julius Nepos to sit on the highest throne of Rome, and gave support to seize power.</p>
                <p>Glycerius surrendered immediately after Nepos in 474 AD gained popular support when he returned from Constantinople. This was due to his main supporter, Gundobad surrendering without a fight.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, Glycerius was appointed bishop at Salonae to comfort him for the loss of the throne. The news is recorded in a short manuscript about Roman rule in the 5th century, Anonymus Valesianus:</p>
                <p>“Therefore, by order of the emperor Zeno, the nobleman Nepos, who arrived from Constantinople in the port of the city of Rome, deposed Glycerius from the post of emperor and appointed him bishop, and Nepos was appointed emperor in Rome.”</p>
                <p>Thanks to the success of Nepos, Dalmatia became part of western Roman rule. The problem, however, was that the Romans had to lose control of Gaul (France), for Euric the Visigothic king declared his independence from the Romans who followed the geiseric and vandal who had become independent first.</p>
                <p>In the Gaulish conflict, Nepos did not send any troops. The Visigoths were finally recognized as sovereign in most of Gaul and most of Spain in 475 AD.</p>
                <p>Historian Ralph W. Mathisen of the University of South Carolina at the Roman Emperors assesses, the year 475 AD is a marker “the western Roman empire was on its own feet for the last time. Its geographical ownership has shrunk to Italy and several lands south of Gaul.”</p>
                <p>It was also in that year that Nepos succeeded Gaul Ecdicius a military leader with Orestes. The poor condition of western Rome made Orestes actually appoint his son, Romulus Augustulus as emperor.</p>
                <p>“When he learned of this, Nepos fled to Dalmatia,” the narration in Anonymus Valesianus reads. At that time, Nepos fled Rome and Orestes hunted him down with military force. Nepos could only resign and fled to his hometown of Dalmatia.</p>
                <p>In short, the Romans were still led by Nepos despite being in exile based on eastern recognition. Originally, it was Orestes who wanted to become emperor, but because it was suspended for two months for a decision from the east, he appointed his young son more during Nepos’s escape.</p>
                <p>“The most serious problem facing the new government is how to manage the diverse barbarian forces that are allegedly under its command,” Mathisen explained.</p>
                <p>“One way to do that is to pay them.  Romulus’s golden solidi was issued in Rome, Milan, and possibly Ravenna. And one problem facing the craftsmen was putting the whole name ‘Romulus Augustus’ in the coin.” But there has never been a Roman coin that minted the name.</p>
                <p>Military problems escalated a year later when the soldiers filed demands for a land grant that Orestes refused. As a result, the soldiers shifted their support to Odovacar, the Germanic chieftain who granted their request. As a result, resistance occurred on August 23 to fight Orestes and was killed.</p>
                <p>Ravenna was occupied by Odovacar and made the young Romulus Augustulus demoted from the throne, but was not killed because of his compassion and age. Anonymus Valesianus reported that Romulus was exiled in the castle of Lucullan in Campania (southern part of Italy).</p>
                <p>This news reached the emperor Zeno in eastern Rome. However, conditions in the west could not be controlled and the surviving Nepos was never able to return to sit on the Throne of Rome after Odovacar took control of Italy. The majesty of western Rome instantly fell, and Europe entered a new chapter of civilization: the dark middle ages.</p>
